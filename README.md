## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
 - From the word model, it is a representation or a structure for developing software, that build business applications via sevices, and it can be combined by different services that can perform some complex tasks and to also reuse the sevices across the systems.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

 - Standardized Service Contrants: this explains every purpose, the capabilities, and the contracts or guideline that can be used in the services.

 Loose Coupling: here the service are minimizing the dependency in order to have some unique or specific types of relationship that maybe outisde or inside the service boundary.

 Abstraction: it hides the data or anything that the customer don't need to see.

 Service Reusability: every complex or logical are divided in order to maximize the services usability.

 Autonomy: The sevices need to have its quality and state, it shoullld carry its logic independently in order to have the predictability.

 Statelessness: this increases the growing amount or the scalability of the service, this can alsoe improve service reuse.
 
 Discoverability: services should be easily discovered, this should have an appropirate data.

 Composability: Services should be flexible and the big problems are break into little parts, where it would be understand easily.

 Interoperability: Here we should have big standards in order to provide the quality services, this is a principle in order to satisfy the standards for the service offered.

3. Define Microservices.
 - From the word 'micro' this are small but independent services, these are also reusable, these are used to build the individual applications that are also scalable. complexity and its a agile. since it's micro services this also reduce the waste and cost that are related to the scale of the applications.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
 -Isolation:  Developers can choose to utilize a different service in case one of the components fails, and the application would still function on its own. Engineers may create and implement services in this manner without having to modify the entire application.

 Scalability: Development teams may more easily scale up or down in response to the needs of individual elements thanks to the microservices design, which is built on tiny components.

 Productivity: since it is micro and that the things are in small and reusable, things are certain to be productive by how small the scalability.

 Flexibility: The developers may select the appropriate tools for each work with the help of the microservice method.

 Faster project development: Since Microservices works independently, it will deliever the app faster.

 Evolutionary: This is by keeping the programs running without stuttering or pausing, developers can deliver regulated and fast updates.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
 -The similarities are they are both are scalable and reusable, they are also both flexible 

 the differences is about their communication, micro sevice have it's own communication protocol since their service is developed independently, meanwhile SOA share common communication mechanism. Their Interoperability Microservices have lightweight messenging protocol and SOAs are heterogeneous messaging protocols. Service granularity Microservice are highly specialized services, SOAs have small range, specialized services to enterprise wide services. Speed SOA operates slowly than microservice.
